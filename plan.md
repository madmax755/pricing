## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a robust and high-performance derivatives pricing engine using Monte Carlo simulation techniques in Rust. The project will feature:

- A flexible simulation engine capable of generating multiple asset price paths based on Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM).
- Implementation of various derivative payoff modules (e.g., European options, Asian options, Barrier options, Lookback options).
- Integration of variance reduction techniques (such as Sobol sequences and antithetic variates) for enhanced accuracy.
- A real-time dashboard that visually demonstrates simulation progress, pricing convergence, and a side-by-side comparison with the Black-Scholes analytical model.
- Detailed performance benchmarks and diagnostic tools to showcase the efficiency of the implementation.

## System Architecture

The system is divided into two primary components:

1. **Simulation Engine:**  
   - Core module responsible for generating asset price paths and calculating derivative payoffs.
   - Implements risk-neutral pricing and variance reduction.
   - Written in Rust to leverage memory safety, performance, and concurrency features.

2. **Real-Time Dashboard:**  
   - User interface (CLI or web-based) that displays live simulation results.
   - Provides interactive parameter tuning, visualizations of price paths, and performance metrics.
   - Includes dual display panels for Black-Scholes and Monte Carlo pricing outputs.

## Simulation Engine Design

### Asset Price Simulation using GBM

- **Model Equation:**  
  \[
  S_{t+\Delta t} = S_t \exp\left((\mu - \frac{1}{2}\sigma^2)\Delta t + \sigma \sqrt{\Delta t}\,\epsilon\right)
  \]
  - \(S_t\): Current asset price.
  - \(\mu\): Drift (global or time-dependent).
  - \(\sigma\): Volatility (global or time-dependent).
  - \(\Delta t\): Time increment (in years).
  - \(\epsilon\): Random variable from a standard normal distribution.

- **Parameter Estimation:**  
  - **Constant Parameters:** Use historical averages or risk-neutral assumptions.
  - **Time-Dependent Parameters (Advanced):** Calibrate using historical data or market implied volatilities.

### Monte Carlo Simulation Loop

- **Simulation Process:**
  - Generate a large number of asset price paths.
  - For each path, calculate the derivative's payoff.
  - Discount payoffs to the present value using a risk-free rate.
- **Parallelization:**  
  - Utilize Rust's Rayon crate to run simulations concurrently.
  - Aggregate results from different threads for final pricing.

### Variance Reduction Techniques

- **Sobol Sequences / Quasi-Monte Carlo:**  
  - Improve sample coverage of the simulation space.
- **Antithetic Variates:**  
  - Generate complementary simulation pairs to reduce variance.
- **Optional Additional Techniques:**  
  - Consider control variates if applicable.

### Advanced Model Extensions

- **Stochastic Volatility Models:**
  - Implement Heston model for stochastic volatility
  - Compare pricing accuracy against standard GBM for options with longer maturities
  
- **Jump Diffusion Models:**
  - Add Merton jump-diffusion model to capture market shocks
  - Implement Kou's double exponential jump diffusion model
  - Demonstrate improved accuracy for pricing options with fat-tailed distributions

- **Local Volatility Models:**
  - Implement Dupire's local volatility model
  - Calibrate to market volatility surface
  - Compare with constant volatility assumptions

- **Multi-Asset Models:**
  - Extend to multi-dimensional GBM with correlation matrix
  - Price basket options and spread options
  - Implement Cholesky decomposition for correlated random variables

## Pricing Derivatives

### Payoff Functions

- **European Options:**  
  - Call: \(\max(S_T - K, 0)\)
  - Put: \(\max(K - S_T, 0)\)
- **Exotic Options:**  
  - Asian Options: Use the average asset price over the simulation period.
  - Barrier Options: Monitor if/when the asset price crosses a predetermined level.
  - Lookback Options: Record the maximum or minimum asset price during the simulation.

### Discounting and Risk-Neutral Pricing

- **Discounting:**  
  - Each simulated payoff is discounted using:
    \[
    \text{Discount Factor} = e^{-rT}
    \]
  - \(r\) is the risk-free rate and \(T\) is the time to maturity.
- **Risk-Neutral Framework:**  
  - The simulation uses a drift equal to the risk-free rate to align with market pricing assumptions.
